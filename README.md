The timing of how long to enable the Cicero enablement can be changed through its `config.yml`, present in the `FWCicero` folder generated by the plugin itself at startup.
By running the `/cicero help` command or clicking on it, the following list will appear:

These are all the commands allowed inside the plugin, many of these require the `forgotten.cicero.mod` permission to run.

To start the city tour, just enter the command `/cicero` e in chat
it will automatically be teleported to the **coordinates set** for that city or to its **t spawn**.
The player can check the status of his remaining time to use the Cicero by typing the command `/cicero timeleft` and this will show him the following screen:

After the tour of the cities, the Cicero plugin will teleport the player to the coordinates indicated in the configuration file `config.yml` and remove any authorization to use the Cicero itself.
